# Support

Are you in need of some support for an SDK?
We have multiple channels available for you to request help.

## Where to get help

We have general support available at our [zksync-developers Discussions](https://github.com/zkSync-Community-Hub/zksync-developers/discussions)
where you can submit a question. We also have a [Discord community](https://join.zksync.dev/)
that may help with any troubleshooting.

If you have questions related to any of our zkSync tools,
we recommend that you submit an Issue related to that project.
You can find the list of our open-source repositories in the [Contribution Track](https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/contribution-track)
