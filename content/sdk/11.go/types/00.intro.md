# Types

Types are placed in three packages for different purposes:

- [`types`](types): Contains common and general types used to build basic features and other types.
- [`eip712`](eip712): Contains types used for EIP-712 implementation.
- [`clients`](clients): Contains types that are meant to be used along with [`Client`](clients).
- [`accounts`](accounts): Contains types that are meant to be used along with an account, specifically with the
  [`Adapter`](../accounts) abstraction. Many types are similar to those from the `geth` library, but the `From` or
  `Signer` fields are omitted because these fields are inherited from `Adapter`, which already has an
   associated account.
