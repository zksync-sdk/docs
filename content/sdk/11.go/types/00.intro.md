Types are placed in three packages for different purposes:

- [`types`](/sdk/go/types/types): Contains common and general types used to build basic features and other types.
- [`eip712`](/sdk/go/types/eip712): Contains types used for EIP-712 implementation.
- [`clients`](/sdk/go/types/clients): Contains types that are meant to be used along with [`Client`](/sdk/go/clients).
- [`accounts`](/sdk/go/types/accounts): Contains types that are meant to be used along with an account,
  specifically with the [`Adapter`](/sdk/go/types/accounts) abstraction.
  Many types are similar to those from the `geth` library, but the `From` or `Signer` fields are omitted
  because these fields are inherited from `Adapter`, which already has an associated account.
