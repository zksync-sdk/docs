Whether youâ€™re facing integration challenges, encountering unexpected errors, or need clarity on certain
functionalities, here are detailed solutions and best practices to ensure a smooth development experience.

### JavaScript SDK

If you encounter issues using the JavaScript SDK during the installation, refer to the troubleshooting steps:

1. **Network selection**: Ensure you are using the Layer 2 (L2) network instead of Layer 1 (L1) Sepolia. The
correct endpoint for the L2 network is: [ZKsync Sepolia Explorer](%%zk_testnet_block_explorer_url%%/).

2. **Transaction hash and block tag**: Use the correct transaction hash and block tag when fetching transaction details.

### Bun

If you encounter issues using Bun during the installation, refer to the troubleshooting steps in the table below.

##### 1. Network timeout

- **Possible cause**: Slow or unstable internet connection
- **Solution**: Increase the timeout duration by using: `curl -fsSL --connect-timeout 60 https://bun.sh/install | bash`

##### 2. Manual download required

- **Possible cause**: Automatic download fails
- **Solution**: Manually download the Bun binary from
the [Bun releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/releases/latest). Extract the binary and place it in a
directory that is in your system's PATH.

##### 3. Permissions issue

- **Possible cause**: Bun binary is not executable
- **Solution**: Ensure the Bun binary is executable by running: `chmod +x ~/.bun/bin/bun`

##### 4. PATH not updated

- **Possible cause**: `~/.bun/bin` not in PATH
- **Solution**: Verify and manually add it to your PATH by editing your shell configuration
file (`~/.zshrc` for zsh): `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc`

##### 5. TTY initialization failed

- **Possible cause**: Terminal handling issues or TTY not supported
- **Solution**: Run without TTY by setting the environment variable: `NO_TTY=1 bun install` or disable
telemetry: `export NUXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`

##### 6. Telemetry prompt issue

- **Possible cause**: Nuxt telemetry prompt causing issues
- **Solution**: Set an environment variable to disable the telemetry prompt: `export NUXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`

##### 7. Conflicting aliases

- **Possible cause**: Conflicts with existing aliases or functions
- **Solution**: Ensure there are no conflicting aliases or functions named `bun` by running: `type bun`

##### 8. Reinitialize shell

- **Possible cause**: Shell environment not refreshed
- **Solution**: Completely reinitialize your shell environment by starting a new shell session: `exec /bin/zsh`
