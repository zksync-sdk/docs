If you encounter issues while using the zkSync-era Javascript V5 SDK, please refer to the following troubleshooting tips:

1. **Network Selection**: Ensure you are using the Layer 2 (L2) network instead of Layer 1 (L1) Sepolia. The correct
endpoint for the
L2 network is: [zkSync Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/).

### Issues, Causes, and Solutions

#### 1. Network Timeout

- **Possible Cause**: Slow or unstable internet connection
- **Solution**: Increase the timeout duration by using: `curl -fsSL --connect-timeout 60 https://bun.sh/install | bash`

#### 2. Manual Download Required

- **Possible Cause**: Automatic download fails
- **Solution**: Manually download the Bun binary from the [Bun releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/releases/latest).
  Extract the binary and place it in a directory that is in your system's PATH.

#### 3. Permissions Issue

- **Possible Cause**: Bun binary is not executable
- **Solution**: Ensure the Bun binary is executable by running: `chmod +x ~/.bun/bin/bun`

#### 4. PATH Not Updated

- **Possible Cause**: `~/.bun/bin` not in PATH
- **Solution**: Verify and manually add it to your PATH by editing your shell configuration file (`~/.zshrc` for zsh):
  `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc`

#### 5. TTY Initialization Failed

- **Possible Cause**: Terminal handling issues or TTY not supported
- **Solution**: Run without TTY by setting the environment variable: `NO_TTY=1 bun install` or disable telemetry:
  `export NUXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`

#### 6. Telemetry Prompt Issue

- **Possible Cause**: Nuxt telemetry prompt causing issues
- **Solution**: Set an environment variable to disable the telemetry prompt: `export NUXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`

#### 7. Conflicting Aliases

- **Possible Cause**: Conflicts with existing aliases or functions
- **Solution**: Ensure there are no conflicting aliases or functions named `bun` by running: `type bun`

#### 8. Reinitialize Shell

- **Possible Cause**: Shell environment not refreshed
- **Solution**: Completely reinitialize your shell environment by starting a new shell session: `exec /bin/zsh`
