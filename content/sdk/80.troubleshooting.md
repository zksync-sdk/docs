Whether youâ€™re facing integration challenges, encountering unexpected errors, or need clarity on certain
functionalities, here are detailed solutions and best practices to ensure a smooth development experience.

### JavaScript SDK

If you encounter issues using the JavaScript SDK during the installation, refer to the troubleshooting steps:

1. **Network selection**: Ensure you are using the Layer 2 (L2) network instead of Layer 1 (L1) Sepolia. The
correct endpoint for the L2 network is: [ZKsync Sepolia Explorer](%%zk_testnet_block_explorer_url%%/).

2. **Transaction hash and block tag**: Use the correct transaction hash and block tag when fetching transaction details.
