A Web3 Provider object provides application-layer access to underlying blockchain networks. It serves as a crucial
interface for interacting with various blockchain functionalities, enabling developers to connect, communicate, and
perform operations on the blockchain.

The [`zksync2`](https://pypi.org/project/zksync2/) library supports provider methods from
the [`web3.py`](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/providers.html) library and supplies additional functionality
tailored for the ZKsync Era network.

### Key features of providers

- **Network Connectivity:** Establishes connections to blockchain networks, allowing applications to interact with them.
- **Transaction Management:** Facilitates the creation, sending, and tracking of transactions.
- **Gas Estimation:** Provides estimations for the amount of gas required for transactions.
- **Account Management:** Retrieves balances and transaction histories for accounts.
- **Contract Interaction:** Enables interaction with smart contracts, including deploying and calling contract methods.
