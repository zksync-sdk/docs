## Connecting to ZKsync Era

Once you have all the necessary dependencies, connect to ZKsync Era using the endpoint of the operator node.

```python
from zksync2.module.module_builder import ZkSyncBuilder
...
sdk = ZkSyncBuilder.build("https://sepolia.era.zksync.dev")
```

Get chain id:

```python
chain_id = zk_web3.zksync.chain_id
```

Get block number:

```python
block_number = zk_web3.zksync.block_number
```

Get the transaction by hash:

```ts
transaction = zksync_web3.zksync.eth_get_transaction_by_hash(hash);
```

Also, the following examples demonstrate how to:

1. Deposit ETH and tokens from Ethereum into ZKsync Era
2. Transfer ETH and tokens on ZKsync Era
3. Withdraw ETH and tokens from ZKsync Era to Ethereum
4. Use paymaster to pay fee with token

Full code for all examples is available in the [ZKsync Python guide](https://github.com/zksync-sdk/zksync2-examples/tree/main/python).
Examples are configured to interact with `ZKsync Era` and `Sepolia` test networks.
