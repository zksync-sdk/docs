Welcome to the SDK Documentation website.

## Writing content

You can just start writing `.md` or `.yml` files in the [`content/`](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/content-directory)
directory to have your pages updated. The navigation will be automatically generated in the left aside and in the mobile
menu. You will also be able to go through your content with full-text search.
