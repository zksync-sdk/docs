The `zksync2-swift` SDK provides robust classes for managing and signing transactions within the ZKsync network. The
primary classes involved in account management and transaction signing are:

- `Wallet`: A comprehensive class for handling various wallet-related operations.
- `BaseSigner`: A class used to sign `EIP712`-typed ZKsync transactions.

These classes enable secure and efficient handling of transactions on the ZKsync network, providing developers with
powerful tools for managing accounts and signing transactions within the ZKsync ecosystem.
