Types are placed in three packages for different purposes:

- [`types`](/sdk/go/api/types/types): Contains common and general types used to build basic features and other types.
- [`eip712`](/sdk/go/api/eip712/eip712): Contains types used for EIP-712 implementation.
- [`clients`](/sdk/go/api/clients/types): Contains types that are meant to be used along with [`Client`](/sdk/go/api/clients/introduction).
- [`accounts`](/sdk/go/api/accounts/types): Contains types that are meant to be used along with an account, specifically
with the [`Adapter`](/sdk/go/api/accounts/types) abstraction. Many types are similar to those from the `geth` library, but
the `From` or `Signer` fields are omitted because these fields are inherited from `Adapter`, which already has an
associated account.
