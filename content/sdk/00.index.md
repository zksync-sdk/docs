**zksync Era** is a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. It uses a special technology called **ZK rollup**. This technology
makes transactions faster and cheaper while keeping the security and trust of the Ethereum blockchain.

## Benefits of zksync Era SDKs

These SDKs, available in various programming languages, streamline the process of building decentralized applications
(dApps) that leverage zksync Era's benefits, including:

- **Scalability**: Massively reduced transaction fees and faster confirmation times compared to Ethereum.
- **Security**: Inherits security from the underlying Ethereum blockchain.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Enables smoother and more cost-effective dApp interactions for users.
- **Paymaster Support**: Enables flexible transaction fee payment strategies:
  - Third-party services can cover fees for users, fostering wider adoption.
  - Gasless transactions become possible, improving user experience.
- **Account Abstraction**:
  - Enhances security and privacy by separating user accounts from keys.
  - Improves developer experience by simplifying account management and enabling features like multi-signature wallets
    and on-chain governance.
