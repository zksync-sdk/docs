**zkSync Era** is a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. It uses a special technology called **ZK rollup**. This technology
makes transactions faster and cheaper while keeping the security and trust of the Ethereum blockchain.

#### Key Points

1. **zkSync Era SDKs**: These are like toolkits for developers. They make it easier to create dApps on zkSync Era.
2. **zkSync Era Network**: This network helps make Ethereum transactions quicker and less expensive.
3. **ZK Rollup Technology**: This is a method that bundles many transactions into one, making them faster and cheaper
but still very secure.

In simple terms, zkSync Era SDKs give developers the tools they need to build apps that work quickly and cheaply on the
Ethereum network without losing security.
