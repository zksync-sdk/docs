## What is zkSync Era SDKs?

zkSync Era SDKs help developers create decentralized applications (dApps) for the zkSync Era network. zkSync Era is a
Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. It uses ZK rollup technology to provide scalable and low-cost transactions, keeping the
security and trust of the Ethereum blockchain.

## Benefits of zkSync Era SDKs

These SDKs, available in various programming languages, streamline the process of building decentralized applications
(dApps) that leverage zkSync Era's benefits, including:

- **Scalability**: Massively reduced transaction fees and faster confirmation times compared to Ethereum.
- **Security**: Inherits security from the underlying Ethereum blockchain.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Enables smoother and more cost-effective dApp interactions for users.
- **Paymaster Support**: Enables flexible transaction fee payment strategies:
  - Third-party services can cover fees for users, fostering wider adoption.
  - Gasless transactions become possible, improving user experience.
- **Account Abstraction**:
  - Enhances security and privacy by separating user accounts from keys.
  - Improves developer experience by simplifying account management and enabling features like multi-signature wallets
    and on-chain governance.

## Integration

To integrate third-party SDKs with zkSync Era, follow these key steps to ensure your decentralized application (dApp) can
use zkSync Era's scalable, secure, and low-cost transactions.
