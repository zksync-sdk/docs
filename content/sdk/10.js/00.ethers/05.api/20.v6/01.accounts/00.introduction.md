`zksync-ethers` exports the following classes that can sign transactions on ZKsync:

- `Wallet` class is an extension of the `ethers.Wallet` with additional ZKsync features.
- `EIP712Signer` class used to sign `EIP712`_-typed_ ZKsync transactions.
- `Signer` and `L1Signer` classes should be used for browser integration.
- `VoidSigner` and `L1VoidSigner` classes should be designed to allow an address to
be used in any API that accepts a `Signer` but for which no credentials are available to perform any actual signing.
- `SmartAccount`, which provides better support for account abstraction. There are the following factory classes:
  - `ECDSASmartAccount`: uses a single ECDSA key to sign the payload.
  - `MultisigECDSASmartAccount`: uses multiple ECDSA keys for signing payloads.
