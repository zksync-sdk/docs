`zksync-ethers` exports the following classes that can sign transactions on ZKsync:

- `Wallet` class is an extension of the `ethers.Wallet` with additional ZKsync features.
- `EIP712Signer` class that is used to sign `EIP712`_-typed_ ZKsync transactions.
- `Signer` and `L1Signer` classes, which should be used for browser integration.
- `VoidSigner` and `L1VoidSigner` classes, which should be used for designed to allow an address to
  be used in any API which accepts a `Signer`, but for which there are no credentials available to
  perform any actual signing.
- `SmartAccount` which provides better support for account abstraction. There are following factory classes:
  - `ECDSASmartAccount`: uses a single ECDSA key for signing payload.
  - `MultisigECDSASmartAccount`: uses multiple ECDSA keys for signing payloads.
