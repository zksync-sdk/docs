This section explains how to send transactions between L1 and L2 networks using the `zksync-ethers` library.

If you need background information on how L1<->L2 interactions work on ZKsync, check out the [introduction](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/l1-l2-interop.html).

## Deposit

`Wallet` and `L1Signer` objects allow you to deposit funds from L1 to L2.

- **More Information**: See the method specification [`Deposit`](/sdk/js/ethers/v5/accounts#deposit).
- **Example**: [Deposit ETH and ERC20 token](https://github.com/zksync-sdk/zksync2-examples/blob/main/js/src/01_deposit.ts).

## Request Execute

`Wallet` and `L1Signer` objects let you request the execution of an L2 transaction from L1.

- **More Information**: See the method specification [`requestExecute`](/sdk/js/ethers/v5/accounts#requestexecute).

## Base Cost

`Wallet` and `L1Signer` objects can calculate the base cost for an L2 transaction.

- **More Information**: See the method specification [`getBaseCost`](/sdk/js/ethers/v5/accounts#getbasecost).

## Claim Failed Deposit

`Wallet` and `L1Signer` objects provide a way to claim a failed deposit.

- **More Information**: See the method specification [`claimFailedDeposit`](/sdk/js/ethers/v5/accounts#claimfaileddeposit).

## Finalize Withdraw

`Wallet` and `L1Signer` objects allow you to finalize a withdrawal from L2 to L1.

- **More Information**: See the method specification [`finalizeWithdrawal`](/sdk/js/ethers/v5/accounts#finalizewithdrawal).

## Withdrawal

`Wallet` and `Signer` objects enable you to withdraw funds from L2 to L1.

- **More Information**: See the method specification [`Withdraw`](/sdk/js/ethers/v5/accounts#withdraw).
- **Example**: [Withdraw ETH and ERC20 token](https://github.com/zksync-sdk/zksync2-examples/blob/main/js/src/04_withdraw.ts).
