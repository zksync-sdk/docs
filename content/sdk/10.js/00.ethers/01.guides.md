Welcome to the ZKsync JavaScript SDK guide. This tutorial will help you get started with using the ZKsync SDK for
various operations like wallet management, transactions, and error handling.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js or Yarn installed on your system
- An Ethereum wallet like MetaMask

## Installation

First, let's install the ZKsync SDK. Open your terminal and run the following command:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn add zksync ethers
```

```bash [npm]
npm install zksync ethers
```

::

## Setting Up

To get started, you'll need to import the necessary modules and set up your provider. Here’s how to do it:

```javascript
const { Provider, Wallet, utils } = require('zksync-ethers');
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

// Connect to the ZKsync network
const provider = new Provider('https://sepolia.era.zksync.dev');
```

## Wallet Management

### Creating a Wallet

You can create a new wallet using a private key or a mnemonic phrase. Here’s an example of creating a
wallet using a private key:

```javascript
const PRIVATE_KEY = 'your-private-key-here';
const wallet = new Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

console.log(`Wallet address: ${wallet.address}`);
```

### Checking Balance

To check the balance of your wallet, use the `getBalance` method:

```javascript
(async () => {
  const balance = await wallet.getBalance();
  console.log(`Balance: ${ethers.utils.formatEther(balance)} ETH`);
})();
```

## Transactions

### Sending Ether

Sending Ether using the ZKsync SDK is straightforward. Here’s an example of how to send Ether from one address to another:

```javascript
(async () => {
  const recipient = 'recipient-address-here';
  const amount = ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01');

  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
    to: recipient,
    value: amount,
  });

  console.log(`Transaction hash: ${tx.hash}`);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log('Transaction confirmed');
})();
```

### Estimating Gas

You can estimate the gas required for a transaction using the `estimateGas` method:

```javascript
(async () => {
  const gasEstimate = await wallet.estimateGas({
    to: 'recipient-address-here',
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
  });

  console.log(`Estimated gas: ${gasEstimate.toString()}`);
})();
```

## Error Handling

Handling errors gracefully is crucial in any application. Here’s an example of how to catch and handle errors
when sending a transaction:

```javascript
(async () => {
  try {
    const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
      to: 'recipient-address-here',
      value: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
    });

    console.log(`Transaction hash: ${tx.hash}`);
    await tx.wait();
    console.log('Transaction confirmed');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
  }
})();
```

## Advanced Features

The ZKsync SDK provides many advanced features such as interacting with smart contracts, batch transactions, and
more. Refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.zksync.io/sdk/js/ethers) for detailed information on these features.

## What Next?

With these fundamentals, you're ready to explore more advanced features and build robust applications on the ZKsync network.

Happy coding!
