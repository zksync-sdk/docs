This section describes how to make the most of zkSync to provide the best UX.

## Going to production right away

If your front-end code does not deploy new smart contracts, then no changes to the codebase are required!
All the existing SDKs/infrastructure will work out-of-box.

## Enabling zkSync features

If you want to deploy smart contracts or enable advanced zkSync features, like account abstraction,
then you need to use the `zksync-ethers` library. You can read about the basics [here](/sdk/js/ethers/v6/features).
